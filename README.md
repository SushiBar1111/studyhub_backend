This is a backend for my mobile application. My mobile application called StudyHub is a similar app to dating app but for finding friends to study together based on your subject interest,
preferred study place, your learning type, etc.

NOTE:
1. Preference and interest only used for storing preferences model and interest mmodel.
2. Different feature has a different django app. e.g. filter, search, Profile, etc.
3. This is a college assignment not for used publicly
4. All of the codes maybe will fill un-structured, well because this is my first time creating a mobile app.
