This is a backend for my team's mobile application. Our mobile application called StudyHub is a similar app to dating app but for finding friends to study together based on your subject interest,
preferred study place, your learning type, etc. This is our university project.

NOTE:
1. Preference and interest only used for storing preferences model and interest model.
2. Different feature is in a different django app to each other. e.g. filter, search, Profile, and other are different django app. We make it like this so that we won't get confused to develop each feature.
3. This is our college assignment/project, not for used publicly.
4. All of the codes maybe will feel un-structured, because this is our first time creating a mobile app.
